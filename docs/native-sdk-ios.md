# iOS SDK

The iOS SDK in this repo is the Swift wrapper over the shared Rust wallet backend.

Relevant paths:

- `bindings/ios-sdk/`
- `crates/pirate-ffi-native/`
- `crates/pirate-wallet-service/`

The Swift code is a typed wrapper. Wallet behavior lives in the Rust service layer.

## Scope

The iOS SDK is intended to match the Android SDK boundary.

That includes:

- wallet create and restore
- watch-only wallet import
- receive addresses
- balances
- optional Sapling and Ironwood split balances
- sync control
- a polling synchronizer wrapper
- send, build, sign, and broadcast
- shielded address validation
- consensus branch validation
- transaction details, recipients, and memo lookup
- payment disclosure export and verification for sent shielded outputs/actions
- viewing key export and watch-only import

There is also an advanced key-management surface for higher-risk operations:

- list key groups
- export Sapling and Ironwood viewing keys
- export Sapling and Ironwood spending keys
- import Sapling and Ironwood spending keys
- raw seed export

Those live under `sdk.advancedKeyManagement`.

The boundary is the same one used for the Android SDK.

## Mnemonic language support

The iOS SDK now supports explicit BIP39 seed phrase language handling for:

- wallet creation
- wallet restore
- mnemonic generation
- mnemonic validation
- mnemonic inspection
- advanced seed export

Supported languages:

- `english`
- `chineseSimplified`
- `chineseTraditional`
- `french`
- `italian`
- `japanese`
- `korean`
- `spanish`

Behavior:

- create and generate use the requested language when provided
- restore and validate attempt autodetection when the language is omitted
- `inspectMnemonic(...)` / `inspectMnemonicAsync(...)` report:
  - `isValid`
  - `detectedLanguage`
  - `ambiguousLanguages`
  - `wordCount`
- advanced seed export defaults to the wallet's original stored mnemonic language and can re-render that same seed entropy in another supported language for display/export

## Build

Build the native library and validate its checked-in ABI header:

```bash
bash scripts/build-native-ffi.sh
```

Header generation is an explicit maintainer operation and requires the pinned
cbindgen version. It is intentionally separate from packaging so a runner's
ambient tools can never mutate release inputs:

```bash
cargo install cbindgen --locked --version 0.29.3
bash scripts/generate-native-ffi-header.sh --write
```

Package the iOS SDK:

```bash
bash scripts/build-ios-sdk.sh
```

That script:

- builds `pirate-ffi-native` for device and simulator targets
- creates `PirateWalletNative.xcframework`
- stages the Swift wrapper sources
- writes release bundles under `dist/ios-sdk/`

This packaging step requires macOS and Xcode.

The standard binary SDK uses Direct networking and omits embedded Tor and I2P.
It includes `embedded-sapling-params`. Custom Cargo builds with
`--no-default-features` also omit the proving files and require
`initialize_sapling_parameters` through the JSON service before any signing.

## Networking

The SDK connects directly to the configured lightwalletd server without a
transport setup call. Direct connections expose the device's IP address to the
server and DNS provider. The consuming app owns its network and privacy policy,
including any protection provided by its operating-system network environment.
Tor and I2P integration belongs to Stashi and is excluded from SDK artifacts.

## Outputs

Release outputs:

- `bindings/ios-sdk/Frameworks/PirateWalletNative.xcframework`
- `dist/ios-sdk/PirateWalletNative.xcframework.zip`
- `dist/ios-sdk/PirateWalletSDK-package.zip`

The XCFramework zip is the binary artifact.

The package zip contains the Swift wrapper sources plus the XCFramework layout expected by the checked-in Swift package.

## Package layout

The Swift package is in:

- `bindings/ios-sdk/Package.swift`

The package currently keeps:

- `swift-tools-version: 5.9`

It is the minimum package-tools requirement.

The CI build can use a newer Xcode and newer Swift compiler without forcing the package manifest to require the newest toolchain.

The wrapper sources are in:

- `bindings/ios-sdk/Sources/PirateWalletSDK/`

Full method and type reference:

- `docs/native-sdk-ios-api.md`

Current wrapper files:

- `PirateWalletSDK.swift`
- `PirateWalletSDKModels.swift`
- `PirateWalletSynchronizer.swift`

## Public API

The public Swift surface mirrors the Android SDK structure:

- `PirateWalletSDK`
- `PirateWalletSynchronizer`
- `PirateWalletAdvancedKeyManagement`

The typed SDK now exposes both:

- synchronous methods, for simple tooling and tests
- async `...Async` counterparts, for app integrations that should avoid blocking the caller thread

For normal app usage, prefer the async methods over the synchronous ones.

Birthday height is exposed in two places:

- `sdk.getLatestBirthdayHeight(walletId:)`
- `PirateWalletSynchronizer.latestBirthdayHeight`

That value comes from the wallet metadata already stored by the backend.

The synchronizer keeps its published state on the main actor, but its wallet-service
polling work runs through a dedicated background invocation queue so sync refreshes
do not block the UI thread.

Examples:

```swift
let wallets = try await sdk.listWalletsAsync()
let balance = try await sdk.getBalanceAsync(walletId: walletId)
let txid = try await sdk.sendAsync(walletId: walletId, output: output)
let seed = try await sdk.advancedKeyManagement.exportSeedAsync(walletId: walletId)
```

## Maintenance notes

Source of truth:

- business logic and JSON method handling: `crates/pirate-wallet-service/src/service.rs`
- native C ABI: `crates/pirate-ffi-native/src/lib.rs`
- Swift typed wrapper: `bindings/ios-sdk/Sources/PirateWalletSDK/`

When adding a new iOS SDK method:

1. add or reuse the Rust service method in `pirate-wallet-service`
2. expose it in `crates/pirate-wallet-service/src/service.rs`
3. add the typed Swift wrapper and model decoding
4. keep the iOS and Android SDK boundaries aligned
5. rebuild the XCFramework package on macOS

## Verification

The Swift wrapper has not been host-verified yet because iOS packaging requires macOS and Xcode.

The matching backend and C ABI layers were verified from this repo:

```bash
cd crates
cargo check -p pirate-wallet-service -p pirate-ffi-native
```

On a macOS builder, the normal verification path is:

```bash
bash scripts/build-native-ffi.sh
bash scripts/build-ios-sdk.sh
```

## CI

The iOS SDK CI path now does two things on a macOS runner:

- builds the XCFramework package
- builds and tests the Swift package wrapper

The CI job also selects Xcode explicitly instead of relying on the runner default:

- prefers Xcode 26.3
- falls back to Xcode 26.2 if 26.3 is not installed on the runner image

That means CI should catch wrapper compile breakage and package layout problems after commit.
