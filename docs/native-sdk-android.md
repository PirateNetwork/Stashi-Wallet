# Android SDK

The Android SDK in this repo is the Android wrapper over the shared Rust wallet backend.

Relevant paths:

- `bindings/android-sdk/`
- `crates/pirate-ffi-native/`
- `crates/pirate-wallet-service/`

The Android code is only a typed wrapper. Wallet behavior lives in the Rust service layer.

## What it covers

The SDK is built for the shielded wallet model used by the unified wallet.

That includes:

- wallet create and restore
- watch-only wallet import
- receive addresses
- balances
- optional Sapling and Ironwood split balances
- sync control
- a polling synchronizer surface
- send, build, sign, and broadcast
- shielded address validation
- consensus branch validation
- transaction details, recipients, and memo lookup
- payment disclosure export and verification for sent shielded outputs/actions
- viewing key export and watch-only import

There is also a separate advanced key-management surface for higher-risk operations:

- list key groups
- export Sapling and Ironwood viewing keys
- export Sapling and Ironwood spending keys
- import Sapling and Ironwood spending keys
- raw seed export

Those live under `sdk.advancedKeyManagement`.

## Mnemonic language support

The Android SDK now supports explicit BIP39 seed phrase language handling for:

- wallet creation
- wallet restore
- mnemonic generation
- mnemonic validation
- mnemonic inspection
- advanced seed export

Supported languages:

- `English`
- `ChineseSimplified`
- `ChineseTraditional`
- `French`
- `Italian`
- `Japanese`
- `Korean`
- `Spanish`

Behavior:

- create and generate use the requested language when provided
- restore and validate attempt autodetection when the language is omitted
- `inspectMnemonic(...)` reports:
  - `isValid`
  - `detectedLanguage`
  - `ambiguousLanguages`
  - `wordCount`
- advanced seed export defaults to the wallet's original stored mnemonic language and can re-render that same seed entropy in another supported language for display/export

It deliberately does not expose:

- transparent address and balance APIs
- transparent shielding flows
- rewind helpers
- old callback-style processor error hooks

## Build

Build the native library and validate its checked-in ABI header:

```bash
bash scripts/build-native-ffi.sh
```

Regenerate the public header only when intentionally changing the C ABI:

```bash
cargo install cbindgen --locked --version 0.29.3
bash scripts/generate-native-ffi-header.sh --write
```

Build the Android SDK:

```bash
bash scripts/build-android-sdk.sh
```

That script:

- builds the JNI libraries from `pirate-ffi-native`
- strips unneeded native symbols with the NDK toolchain before Gradle packages the AAR
- runs Android unit tests
- builds the release AAR
- writes release bundles under `dist/android-sdk/`

The script also defaults `GRADLE_USER_HOME` to a repo-local cache so local builds do not depend on a host-global Gradle cache.

## Outputs

Release outputs:

- `bindings/android-sdk/build/outputs/aar/pirate-android-sdk-release.aar`
- `dist/android-sdk/pirate-android-sdk-package.zip`

The AAR is the normal delivery artifact.

The package zip is there for teams that want to vendor the whole Gradle module instead of only consuming the AAR.

## External Sapling parameters

The standard AAR embeds the public Sapling proving files. To build the optional
smaller AAR without those files:

```bash
bash scripts/build-android-sdk.sh --external-sapling-params
```

Outputs go to `dist/android-sdk-external/`:

- `pirate-android-sdk-external-release.aar`
- `pirate-android-sdk-external-package.zip`

Use one AAR variant in the consuming app. The host must obtain the standard
`sapling-spend.params` and `sapling-output.params`, store them in an app-private
directory, and initialize them before signing any transaction, including
Ironwood-only transactions. The shared builder loads the Sapling prover:

```kotlin
// Run on a background dispatcher: validation and parsing read about 51.6 MB.
sdk.initializeSaplingParameters(
    spendPath = File(paramsDirectory, "sapling-spend.params").absolutePath,
    outputPath = File(paramsDirectory, "sapling-output.params").absolutePath,
)
```

Download each file to a temporary file using the host app's network policy and
atomically rename it after completion. Initialize only when both final files are
ready. The SDK does not download files or change the host's privacy settings.

| File | Public download | Bytes | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `sapling-spend.params` | [download.z.cash](https://download.z.cash/downloads/sapling-spend.params) | 47,958,396 | `8e48ffd23abb3a5fd9c5589204f32d9c31285a04b78096ba40a79b75677efc13` |
| `sapling-output.params` | [download.z.cash](https://download.z.cash/downloads/sapling-output.params) | 3,592,860 | `2f0ebbcbb9bb0bcffe95a397e7eba89c29eb4dde6191c339db88570e3f3fb0e4` |

Rust verifies the exact size and hash of each file before parsing and caching
the prover for the process. Before initialization succeeds, unreadable or
corrupted files produce a recoverable `PirateWalletSdkException`; replace them
and retry initialization. After success, repeated calls reuse the cached prover
without reloading files. Embedded builds do not require this call. Keep the files
for initialization after the next app launch. Once initialized, proving works
offline. Receiving and syncing do not need these files. They contain public
cryptographic constants, not wallet keys or other wallet-specific data.

## Using it

If you only want the binary artifact, copy the AAR into the consuming Android project and reference it directly:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation(files("libs/pirate-android-sdk-release.aar"))
}
```

If you want the full module layout, use `pirate-android-sdk-package.zip`.

## Public entry points

The public Kotlin surface is in:

- `bindings/android-sdk/src/main/kotlin/com/pirate/wallet/sdk/PirateWalletSdk.kt`
- `bindings/android-sdk/src/main/kotlin/com/pirate/wallet/sdk/PirateWalletSdkModels.kt`
- `bindings/android-sdk/src/main/kotlin/com/pirate/wallet/sdk/PirateWalletSynchronizer.kt`

Full method and type reference:

- `docs/native-sdk-android-api.md`

Important entry points:

- `PirateWalletSdk`
- `PirateWalletSynchronizer`
- `PirateWalletSdk.advancedKeyManagement`

Birthday height is exposed in two places:

- `sdk.getLatestBirthdayHeight(walletId)`
- `PirateWalletSynchronizer.latestBirthdayHeight`

That value comes from the wallet metadata already stored by the backend.

## Differences from the old Android SDK

The older SDK had processor-heavy and transparent-wallet-heavy surfaces that are not part of this one.

Examples that are not included here:

- `processorInfo`
- rewind helpers
- callback-style processor and chain error hooks
- `new`, `newBlocking`, and `erase`
- transparent wallet flows

For the current unified-wallet design, this SDK is the supported Android surface.

## Working on it

When adding a new Android SDK method:

1. add or reuse the Rust service method in `pirate-wallet-service`
2. expose it in `crates/pirate-wallet-service/src/service.rs`
3. add the typed Kotlin wrapper and parsers
4. add or update JVM tests
5. rebuild the AAR

## Checks

Useful commands:

```bash
cd crates
cargo check -p pirate-wallet-service -p pirate-ffi-native

cd ../bindings/android-sdk
ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk \
ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/opt/android-sdk \
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64 \
GRADLE_USER_HOME=/tmp/gradle-pirate-android-sdk \
./gradlew --no-daemon test compileReleaseKotlin

JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64 \
GRADLE_USER_HOME=/tmp/gradle-pirate-android-sdk \
./gradlew --no-daemon assembleRelease
```

## CI

The Android SDK CI path now checks three things:

- the Rust JNI library build
- the Android SDK unit tests and release AAR build
- a separate Android smoke-consumer app module that compiles against the public SDK surface
